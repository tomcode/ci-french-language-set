French system language set for CodeIgniter
==========================================

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework published by EllisLab.

This repository is one of my independant contributions to the framework. It contains all versions of the french language set since release 1.6.1.

Each release exists as tag (current CI convention) and as branch (more suitable for my workflow).

From time to time I synch CodeIgniter's develop branch with this master branch and translate the added entries. As of now I do not use a develop branch on remote.

You'll find other sources of CodeIgniter language files on the [CodeIgniter Wiki, International sources](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Language_Translation/).
